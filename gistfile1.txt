| In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and
| begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system
| of your machine.

| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards
| to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across
| machines.

| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of
| commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
| different kinds of computers.

| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working
| directory using getwd().
> getwd()
[1] "D:/Users/sibythom/Documents"

| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a

| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks,

| might now try to delete mytest.R using file.remove('mytest.R'), but that

| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are

| Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create .

| To delete a directory you need to use the recursive = TRUE argument with the
| function unlink(). If you don't use recursive = TRUE, R is concerned that
| you're unaware that you're deleting a directory and all of its contents. R
| reasons that, if you don't specify that recursive equals TRUE, you don't know
| that something is in the directory you're trying to delete. R tries to
| prevent you from making a mistake.

| Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an
| analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within
| functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you started with, mess
| around a bunch, and then set them back to the original values at the end.
| This isn't the same as what we have done here, but it seems similar enough to
| mention.
